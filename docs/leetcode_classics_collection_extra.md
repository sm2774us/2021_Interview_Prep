Algorithm Problem Classification
 
An algorithm problem contains 3 parts: input, output and solution/algorithm. The input can be an array, string, matrix, tree, linked list, graph, etc. The algorithm solution can be dynamic programming, binary search, BFS, DFS, or topological sort. The solution can also be a data structure, such as a stack, queue/dequeue, hash set, tree set, hash map, tree (heap, binary search tree, trie, segment tree, binary index tree), disjoint set, etc. In this post, problems are tagged by input data structures or algorithms.
