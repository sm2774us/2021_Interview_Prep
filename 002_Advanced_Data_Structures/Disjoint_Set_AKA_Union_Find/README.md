# Disjoint Sets Data Structure

This is an efficient implementation of the Disjoint Sets data structure, written in Python.

Uses Trees, Union by Rank Heuristic, and Path Compression Heuristic.

Uses 1-based indexing of arrays.

When both union by rank heuristic and path compression heuristic are used, the average running time of each operation is nearly constant.

The code includes examples.
