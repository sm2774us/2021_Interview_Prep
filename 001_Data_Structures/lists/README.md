# Lists

**Lists** are pretty simple data structures. It’s structure keeps track of sequence of items.

```
It’s a collection of items (called nodes) ordered in a linear sequence.
```

#### These nodes don’t need to be allocated next to each other in the memory like an array is.

There is a general theoretical programming concept of a list, and there is the specific implementation of a list data structure, which may have taken this basic list idea and added a whole bunch of functionality. Lists are implemented either as linked lists (singly, doubly, circular, …) or as dynamic array.

#### An Array Vs A List
A **list** is a different kind of data structure from an **array**.
The biggest difference is in the idea of direct access Vs sequential access. Arrays allow both; direct and sequential access, while lists allow only sequential access. And this is because the way that these data structures are stored in memory.
The structure of the list doesn’t support numeric index like an array is.
