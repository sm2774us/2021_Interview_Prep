# Tips on How to be a Good Interviewee

-------------------------------------
The goal of the interviewer is usually not to see if you can solve the problem (though is is the goal for some interviewers). The goal is generally to see how you think your way through a problem. This is to your benefit; if you don't know the answer, that's fine--just think your way though it.

But don't think just to yourself. Think aloud. The interviewer wants to see your thought processes. This benefits you a couple different ways:

* It's easier to think about a problem when you're talking out loud.
* The interviewer can tell if you're getting closer to the right track, and can offer you hints to guide you along.

When you are asked a whiteboarding question, step one is: **understand the question**. Pore over it, describing aloud what the question is asking. If something doesn't make sense, get clarification. If you don't understand the problem, the interviewer will note it, and you'll be extremely unlikely to be successful with the problem.

Keep [Polya's Problem Solving Techniques](./Polya-Problem-Solving-Techniques.md) in mind.

Barely any whiteboarding questions will have obvious answers. Don't get frustrated if you don't see the answer right away. Usually the problems have to be probed and broken down before any kind of answer becomes apparent. Frustration will prevent you from thinking clearly, and will leave a very negative impression on the interviewer.

Instead of being frustrated, look upon the problem as a curiosity that can be explored. Turn the problem over in your head and look at it from different angles. The problem itself is fascinating to look at, even if you can't see the answer.

If it helps, try to imagine that the interviewer is on your team, and that you're working collaboratively. Even if they aren't actually helping, this mindset can put you more at ease and allow you to think more clearly.

Finally, **don't cheat**. ___You'll only be cheating yourself___. Here at LS, the goal is to get practice coming into a semi-stressful environment and being presented with a problem for which you don't know the answer, and have to think on your feet. If you practice the problem in advance, you'll lose out on that opportunity. There's no penalty at Lambda School if you don't get the answer. Use the time to practice solving difficult problems from a cold start.

# A Note on Googling

-------------------------------------
Googling during a whiteboarding pairing session is not forbidden. That being said, Googling should be done within reason. Obviously don't allow your interviewee to just google a solution to the problem. However, checking MDN for a useful method is acceptable, as well as checking Wikipedia for a definition. Use your best judgment as an interviewer.

If the interviewee needs to know a function signature, one approach might be to look it up for them and provide it to them.
